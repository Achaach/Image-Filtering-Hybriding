# Image-Filtering-Hybriding

Introduction:

In this project we will write an image filtering function and use it to create hybrid images using a simplified version of the SIGGRAPH 2006 paper by Oliva, Torralba, and Schyns. Hybrid Images are static images that change in interpretation as a function of the viewing distance. The basic idea is that high frequency tends to dominate perception when it is available but, at a distance, only the low frequency (smooth) part of the signal can be seen. By blending the high frequency portion of one image with the low-frequency portion of another, we will get a hybrid image that leads to different interpretations at different distances.
There are 5 pairs of aligned images given which can be merged reasonably well into hybrid images. The alignment is super important because it affects the perceptual grouping.
